## Humemon Project Outline
This project is meant to simulate an Augmented reality version of pokemon implementing the google cloud vision api, the google maps api,
and a unity plugin which will take form as a android application. I would ideally like to divide this project up into 5 specialty areas, 
that way each one of us can spend time getting good at something specific instead of all of us trying to learn a little bit about everything.

Here are the categories that I have come up with so far: 
* Google Maps API (android studio)
* Google cloud vision API + photo usage (android studio)
* Unity humemon combat development (within unity)
* Cohesion director (brings together components of the app, ex. how to have the app provide necessary resources for the unity combat scene)
* UI stylist/art director

These things are not necessarily easy to learn and I am not fully committed to having the outline have these specific roles. 
If you like to make any changes or modifications please let me know and I will be happy to make such changes. I think in order for this to be 
succesful we will need to spend at least 3 hours each week practicing the skills of our roles in order for us to be able to pump out an app in time.
For the next part of this document, I will list out basic features that I would like this app to have.

### Bare minimum features
* Convert picture to basic humemon, including 3 models
* be able to battle with created humemon
